Google Workspace MCP server — unified access to Google Drive, Docs, Sheets,
Slides, Gmail, and Calendar, using the user's own OAuth credentials.

Key guardrails built into this server:
- No full-document replace tool (prevents formatting/chart destruction)
- gdocs_insert_at_heading auto-resets NORMAL_TEXT (prevents heading style inheritance)
- gdocs_list_comments uses full pagination (no truncation at 20)
- gdocs_replace_section uses heading-to-heading delete+reinsert (safe for reference lists)
- gdocs_find_replace batch mode is atomic (single batchUpdate, prevents edit duplication)
- No raw email send except gmail_send_to_self, which is restricted to an opt-in allowlist
